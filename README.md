Hotel Management Project

Run Main class to get started.

Follow the prompts as they appear.

This program does not handle extreme cases (it's not possible to have 500 people in a single room) but the
program continues.

The suite, deluxe, and standard rooms are ways to help the user decided and are not checked. Only the room size is.

The hotel data is all contained in SampleHotelData.txt. Changing the text document by following the examples will allow
the rooms to be changed. The first number indicates how many rooms followed by lines of room data. Each line is a room
and data is entered "field", then space, then its value. The program will assume that the text file is entered correctly
but it gives a bit of leeway on the formatting.

Rooms that have been reserved are set to unclean and there is currently no function that will clean them.
